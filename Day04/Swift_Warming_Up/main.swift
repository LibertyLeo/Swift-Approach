 Swift does not require you to write a semicolon(';') after each statement in

/*
 You can access the minimum and maximum values of each integer type with its
 'min' and 'max' properties.
 In most cases, you don't need to pick a specific size of integer to use in your
 code. Swift provides an additional integer type, 'Int', which has the same size
 as the current platform's native word size:
 On a 32-bit platform, 'Int' is the same size as Int32.
 On a 64-bit platform, 'Int' is the same size as Int64.

 Integer literals can be written as:

    An octal number, with a '0o' prefix
    A hexadecimal number, with a 0x prefix

 For decimal numbers with an exponent of 'exp', the base number is multiplied 
 by 10^exp.
    1.25e2 means 1.25 x 10^2, or 125.0.
    1.25e-2 means 1.25 x 10^(-2), or 0.0125.

 /*
 For hexadecimal numbers with an exponent of 'exp', the base number is multiplied
 by 2^exp.
    0xFp2 means 15 x 2^2, or 60.0.

 Both integers and floats can be padded with extra zeros and can contain
 underscores to help with readability. Neither type of formatting affects the
 underlying value of the literal

 underscore (_) when you decompose the tuple:

 it might constains some 'Int' value, or it might contain no value at all.
