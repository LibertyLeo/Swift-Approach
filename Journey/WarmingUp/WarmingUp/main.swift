 You can access the minimum and maximum values of each integer type with its
 min and max properties.
 In most cases, you don't need to pick a specific size of integer to use in your
 code. Swift provides an additional integer type, Int, which has the same size
 as the current platform's native word size:
 On a 32-bit platform, Int is the same size as Int32.
 On a 64-bit platform, Int is the same size as Int64.

 multiplied by 2^exp.

 Because the initializer might fail, it returns an optional Int, rather than
 an Int.
 An optional Int is written as Int?, not Int. The question mark indicates
 it might constains some Int value, or it might contain no value at all.

 If you define an optional variable with out providing a default value, the
 variable is automatically set to nil for you
 */

 You can use an if statement to find out whether an optional contains a value
 by comparing the optional against nil.
 If an optioanal has a value, it is considered to be "not equal to" nil
 */

 Once you're sure that the optional dose contain a value, you can access its

 optional's name.

 Write an optional binding for an if statement as follows.

 If you want to manipulate the value of actualNumber within the first branch
 of the if statement,You could write if var actualNumber instead.
 */

 You can include as many optional bindings and Boolean conditions in a single
 if statement as you need to, separated by commas.
 If any of the values in the optional bindings are nil or any Boolean condition
 evaluates to false, the whole if statement's condition is considered to be
 false.
 Example as follows are equivalent.

//  MARK: Implicitly Unwrapped Optionals

/*
 You write an implicitly unwrapped optional by placing an exclamation mark
 (String!) rather than  a question mark (String?) after the type that you
 want to make optional.
 The following example shows the difference in behavior between an optioanl
 string and an implicitly unwrapped optional string when accessing their
 wrapped value as an explicit.

/*
 NOTE:
 If an implicitly unwrapped optional is nil and you try to access its wrapped
 value, you'll trigger a runtime error.

 You can still treat an implicitly unwrapped optional like a normal optional,
 to check if it contains a value.
 */
if assumedString != nil {

/*
 You can also use an implicitly unwrapped optional with optional binding, to
 check and unwrap its value in a single statement.
 */
if let definiteString = assumedString {
    print(definiteString)
}
//  Prints "An implicitly unwrapped optional string."

/*
 NOTE:
 Do not use an implicitly unwrapped optional when there is a possibility of a
 variable becoming nil at a later point. Always use a normal optional type
 if you need to check for a nil value during the lifetime of a variable.

/*
 A function indicates that it can throw an error by including the throws
 keyword in its declaration.

 When you call a function that can throw an error, you prepared the try
 keyword to the expression.

 are handled by a catch clause.

 an opportunity to debug the cause of the absent or invalid value.
 You write an assertion by calling the Swift standard library global
 assert(_:_:file:line:) function.

 NOTE:
 Assertions are disabled when your code is compiled with optimizations, such as
 when an app target's default Release configuration in Xcode.
 */

/*
 Use an assertion whenever a condition has the potential to be false, but must
 definitely be true in order for your code to continue execution.
 Suitable scenarios for an assertion check include:
 An integer subscript Index is passes to a custom subscript implementation,
 but the subscript index value could be too low or too high.
 A value is passed to a function, but an invalid value means that the
 function cannot fulfill its task.
 An optional value is currently nil, but a non-nil value is essential
 for scusequent code to execute successfully,
