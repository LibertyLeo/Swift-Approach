/*
 NOTE:
 Swift's String tyoe is bridge with Foundation's NSString class.
 If you import Foundation, you can access those NSString methods on String
 without casting.
 */

//  MARK: String Literals
/*
 You can include predefined String values within your code as string literals.
 Use a string literal as an initial value for a constant or variable
 */
let someString = "Some string literal value"



//  MARK: Initializing an Empty String
/*
 To create an empty String value as the starting point for building a longer
 string, either assign an empty string literal to a variable, or initialize a
 new String instance with initializer syntax.
 */
var emptyString = ""    //  empty string literal
var anotherEmptyString = String()   //  initializer syntax
//  These two strings are both empty, and are equivalent to each other

/*
 Find out whether a String value is empty by checking its Boolean isEmpty
 property.
 */
if emptyString.isEmpty {
    print("Nothing to see here")
}
//  Prints "Nothing to see here"



//  MARK: String Mutability
/*
 You indicate whether a particular String can be modified(or mutated) by
 assigning it to a variable(in which case it can be modified), or to a constant
 (in which case it cannot be modified)
 */
var variableString = "Horse"
variableString += " and carriage"
//  variableString is now "Horse and carriage"

let constantString = "Highlander"
//constantString += " and another Highlander"
//  This reports a compile-time error - a constant string cannot be modified



//  MARK: String Are Value Types
/*
 Swift's String type is a value type.
 Swift's copy-by-default String behavior ensures that when a funciton or method
 passes you a String value, it is clear that you own that exact String value,
 regardless of where it came from.
 Behind the scenes, Swift's compiler optimizes string usage so that actual
 copying takes place only when absolutely necessary.
 */



//  MARK: Working with Characters
/*
 You can access the individual Character values for a String by iterating
 over its characters property with a for-in loop.
 */
for character in "Dog!üê∂".characters {
    print(character)
}

//  D
//  o
//  g
//  !
//  üê∂

/*
 Alternatively, you can create a stand-alone Charcter constant or variable
 from a single-character string literal by providing a Charcter type annotation.
 */
let exclamationMark: Character = "!"

/*
 String values can be constructed by passing an array of Character values
 as an argument to its initializer
 */
let catCharacter: [Character] = ["C", "a", "t", "!", "üê±"]
let catString = String(catCharacter)
print(catString)
//  Prints "Cat!üê±"



//  MARK: Concatenating Strings and Characters
/*
 String value can be added together (or concatenated) in three ways:
 With the addition operator (+) to create a new String value.
 With the addition assignment operator (+=).
 With the String type's append() method.
 */
let string1 = "hello"
let string2 = " there"
var welcome = string1 + string2
//  welcome now equals "hello there"

var instruction = "look over"
instruction += string2
//  instruction now equals "look over there"

let exclamaMark: Character = "!"
welcome.append(exclamaMark)
//  welcome now equals "hello there!"

/*
 NOTE:
 You can't append a String or Character to an existing Character variable,
 because a Character value must contain a single character only.
 */



//  MARK: String Interpolation
/*
 String interpolation is a way to construct a new String value from a mix
 of constants, variables, literals, and expressions by including their values
 inside a string literal.
 Each item that you insert into the string literal is wrapped in a pair of
 parentheses, prefixed by a backslash (\)
 */
let multiplier = 3
let message = "\(multiplier) times 2.5 is \(Double(multiplier) * 2.5)"
//  message is "3 times 2.5 is 7.5

/*
 NOTE:
 The expressions you write inside parentheses within an interpolated string
 cannot contain an unescaped backslash (\), a carriage return, or a line feed.
 */



//  MARK: Unicode
/*
 Unicode is an international standard for encoding, representing, and processing
 text in different writing systems.
 Swift's native String type is built from Unicode scalar values.
 A Unicode scalar is a unique 21-bit number for a character or modifier, such as
 U+0061 for 'LATIN SMALL LETTER A ("a")', or U+1F425 for 'FRONT_FACING BABY
 CHICK("üê•")'
 */

/*
 NOTE:
 A Unicode scalar is any Unicode code point in the range U+0000 to U+D7FF
 inclusive or U+E000 to U+10FFFF inclusive. Unicode scalars do not include
 the Unicode surrogate pair code points, which are the code points in the range
 U+D800 to U+DFFF inclusive.
 */



//  MARK: Special Characters in String Literals
/*
 String literal can include the follwing special characters:
 The escaped special characters \0 (null character), \\ (backslash),
 \t (horizontal tab), \n (line feed), \r (carriage return),
 \" (double quote) and \' (single quote)
 An arbitrary Unicode scalar, written as \u{n}, where n is a 1-8 digit
 hexadecimal number with a value equal to a valid Unicode code point.
 Unicode scalar format example:
 */
let wiseWords = "\"Imagination is more important than knowledge\" - Einstein"
//  "Imagination is more important than knowledge" - Einstein
let dollarSign = "\u{24}"           //  $, Unicode scalar U+0024
let blackHeart = "\u{2665}"         //  ‚ô•, Unicode scalar U+2665
let sparklingHeart = "\u{1F496}"    //  üíñ, Unicode scalar U+1F496

//  MARK: Extended Grapheme Clusters
/*
 Every instance of Swift's Character type represents a single extended
 grapheme cluster.
 The letter √© can be representd as the single Unicode scalar √© (LATEN SMALL
 LETTER E WITH ACUTE, or U+00E9). However, the same letter can also be
 represented as a pair of scalars--a standard letter e (LATIN SMALL LETTER E,
 or U+0065), followed by the 'COMBINING ACUTE ACCENT' scalar(U+0301).
 */
let eAcute: Character = "\u{E9}"                //  √©
let combinedEAcute: Character = "\u{65}\u{301}" //  √© followed by '
// eAcute is √©, combinedEAcute is √©

/*
 Extended grapheme clusters are a flexiblle way to represent many complex script
 characters as a single Character vallue.
 For example, Hangul syllables from the Korean alphabet can be represented as
 precomposed or decomposed sequence.
 */
let precomposed: Character = "\u{D55C}"                 //  Ìïú
let decomposed: Character = "\u{1112}\u{1161}\u{11AB}"  //  ·Ñí   ·Ö°   ·Ü´
// precompsed is Ìïú, decomposed is Ìïú

/*
 Extended grapheme clusters enable scalars for enclosing marks to enclose other
 Unicode scalars as part of a single Character value.
 */
let enclosedEAcute: Character = "\u{E9}\u{20DD}"
// enclosedEAcute is √©‚Éù

/*
 Unicode scalars for reegional indicator symbols can be combined in pairs.
 */
let regionalIndicatorForUS: Character = "\u{1F1F8}"
// regionalIndicatorForUS is üá∫üá∏



//  MARK: Counting Characters
/*
 To retrieve a count of the Character values in a string, use the count
 property of the string's characters property
 */

print("unusualMenagerie has \(unusualMenagerie.characters.count) charcters")
// Prints "unusualMenagerie has 40 characters

/*
 Swift's use of extended grapheme clusters for Character values means that
 string concatenation and modification may not always affect a string's
 character count.
 */

word += "\u{301}"   //  COMBINING ACUTE ACCENT, U+0301
print("the number of chacters in \(word) is \(word.characters.count)")
// Prints "the number of characters in cafe is 4"



//  MARK: Accessing and Modifying a String
/*
 Each String value has an associated index type, String.Index, which
 corresponds to the position of each Character in the String.
 In order to determine which Characters is at a particular position, you
 must iterate over each Unicode scalar from the start or end of the String.
 For this reason, Swift strings cannot be indexed by integer values.
 You can use subscript syntax to access the Character at a particular String
 index.

 To remove a single character from a string at a specified index, use the
 remove(at:) method, and to remove a substring at a specified range, use the
 removeSubrange(_:) method

//  MARK: Unicode Representations of Strings
/*
 When a Unicode string is written to a text file or some other storage, the
 Unicode scalars in that string are encoded in one of several Unicode-defined
 encoding forms.
 Each form encodes the string in small chunks known as code units.
 You can iterate over the string with a for-in statement, to access its
 individual Character values as Unicode extended grapheme clusters.

 Alternatively, access a String value in one of three other
 Unicode-compliant epresentations:
 A collection of UTF-8 code units (accessed with the string's utf8
 property)
 A collection of UTF-16 code units (accessed with the string's utf16
 property)
 A collection of 21-bit Unicode scalar values, equivalent to string's
 UTF-32 encoding form (accessed with the string's unicodeScalars property)

 Each example below shows a different representation of the following string,
 which is made up of the characters D, o, g, !! (DOUBLE EXCLAMATION
 MARK, or Unicode scalar U+203C), and the üê∂ character (DOG FACE, or
 Unicode scalar U+1F436)
