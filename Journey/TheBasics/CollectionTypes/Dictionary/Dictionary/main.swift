//  MARK: Dictionaries
/*
 A dictionary store associations between keys of the same type and values of the
 same type in a collection with no defined ordering.
 Each value is associated with a unique key, which acts as an identifier for
 that value within the dictionary.
 Swift's Dictionary type is bridged to Foundation's NSDictionary class.
 */



//  MARK: Dicitonary Type Shorthand Syntax
/*
 The type of a Swift dictionary is written in full as Dictionary<Key, Value>,
 where Key is the type of value that can be used as a dictionary key, and
 Value is the type of value that the dictionary stores for those keys.
 You can also write the type of a dictionary in shorthand form as [Key: Value].
 */



//  MARK: Creating an Empty Dictionary
/*
 As with arrays, you can create an empty Dictionary of a certain type by using
 intializer syntax.
 */
var namesOfIntegers = [Int: String]()
//  namesOfIntegers is an empty [Int: String] dictionary

/*
 If the context already provides type information, you can create an empty
 dictionary with an empty dicitonary literal, which written as [:] (a colon
 inside a pair of square brackets):
 */
namesOfIntegers[16] = "sixteen"
//  namesOfIntegers now contain 1 key-value pair
namesOfIntegers = [:]
//  namesOfIntegers is once again an empty dictionary of type [Int: String]



//  MARK: Creating a Dictionary with a Dictionary Literal
/*
 A dictionary literal is a shorthand way to write one or more key-value pairs as
 a Dictionary collection.
 The key-value pairs written as a list, separated by commas, surrounded by a
 pair of square brackets
 */
var airports: [String: String] = ["YYZ": "Toronto Pearson", "DUB": "Dublin"]

/*
 As with arrays, you don't have to write the type of the dictionary if you're
 intializing it with a dictionary literal whose keys and values have consistent
 types.
 The initialization of airpots could have been written in a shorter form
 instead.
 */
var airportsShort = ["YYZ":" Toronto Pearson", "DUB": "Dublin"]



//  MARK: Accessing and Modifying a Dictionary
/*
 As with an array, you find out the number of items in a Dictionary by
 checking its read-only count property
 */
print("The airports dictionary contains \(airports.count) items.")
//  Prints "The airports dictionary contains 2 items."

/*
 Use the Boolean isEmpty property as a shortcut for checking whether the
 count property is equal to 0
 */

    print("The airports dictionary is empty.")

    print("The airports dictionary is not empty.")
}
//  Prints "The airports dictionary is not empty."

/*
 You can add a new item to a dictionary with subscript syntax. Use a new key of
 the appropriate type as the subscript index, and assign a new value of the
 appropriate type.
 */
airports["LHR"] = "London"
//  the airports dictionary now contains 3 items

/*
 You can also use subscript syntax to change the value associated with a
 particular key.
 */
airports["LHR"] = "London Heathrow"
//  the value for "LHR" has been change to "London Heathrow"

/*
 As an alternative to subscripting, use a dictionary's updateValue(_:forKey:)
 method to set or update the value for a particular key.
 The updateValue(_:forKey:) method sets a value for a key if none exists, or
 updates that value if that key already exists.
 Unlike the old value after performing an update. This enables you to check
 whether or not an update took place.

 The updateValue(_:forKey:) method returns an optional value of the
 dictionary's value. For a dictionary that stores String values, for example,
 the method returns a value of type String?, or "optional String".
 This optional value contains the old value for that key if one existed before
 the update, or nil if no value existed,
 */
if let oldValue = airports.updateValue("Dublin Airprt", forKey: "DUB") {
    print("The old value for DUB was \(oldValue).")
}
//  Prints "The old value for DUB was Dublin."

/*
 You can also use subscripts syntax to retrieve a value from the dictionary for
 a particular key.
 If the dictionary contains a value for the requested key, the subscript returns
 an optional value containing the existing value for the key. Otherwise, the
 subscript returns nil.
 */
if let airportName = airports["DUB"] {
    print("The name of the airport is \(airportName).")
} else {
    print("The airport is not tin the airports dictionary.")
}
//  Prints "The name of the airport is Dublin Airport."

/*
 You can use the subscript syntax to remove a key-value pair from a dictionary
 by assigning a value of nil for that key.
 */
airports["APL"] = "Apple International"
// "Apple International" is not the real airport for APL, so delete it.
airports["APL"] = nil
// APL has now removed from the dictionary

/*
 Alternatively, remove a key-value pair from a dictionary with the
 removeValue(forKey:) method. This method removes the key-value pair if it
 exists and returns the removed value, or returns nil if no value existed.
 */
if let removedValue = airports.removeValue(forKey: "DUB") {
    print("The removed airport's name is \(removedValue).")
} else {
    print("The airports dictionary does not contain a value for DUB.")
}
//  Prints "The removed airport's name is Dublin Airport."



//  MARK: Iterating Over a Dictionary
/*
 You can iterate over the key-value pairs in a dictionary with a for-in loop.
 Each item in the dictionary is returned as a (key, value) tuple, and you can
 decompose the tuple's members into temporary constants or variables as part of
 the iteration
 */
for (airportCode, airportName) in airports {
    print("\(airportCode): \(airportName)")

/*
 You can also retrieve an iterable collection of a dictionary's keys or values
 by accessing its keys and values properties
 */

//  Airport code: YYZ
//  Airport code: LHR

for airportName in airports.values {
    print("Airport name: \(airportName)")

 If you need to use a dicitonary's keys or values with an API that takes an
 Array instance, initialize a new array with the keys or values property
 */

 To iterate over the keys or values of a dictionary in a specific order, use
 the sorted() method on its keys or values property.
