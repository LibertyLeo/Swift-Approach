## Day16 May 31, 2017
The rest part of **`Initializations`** which has been started on May 27.  
I recommend you to look through the comments in first part, or you can skip into
the second part as well.  
In this project, it introduces `Designated`、 `Convenience`、 `Failable` and `Required` initializers.   
Each of them has its own function declared in detail in project.
