# Swift-Approach
Since I first establish this repository, I just want to know how long will it take for looking through the Swift's learning.  
Actually, it takes no more than a month, it only takes a week if you work for 8 hours a day with some basis about objc.  
You may check it out during my commits, on take a look at my [records][Record].

I must admit that the most of comments through each projects are provided by the Apple Inc., and with `(Exp)` signal marked are the official experiments by Apple as well.

Also, I provide two version of Swift 3.0 book for reference.
If you find it hard to read the [Official Version][Official], you can read the [Chinese Version][Chinese], but it take no responsible for any misleading on translation. :-)

Finally, I reconstruct the whole repository based on my self understanding, you can take look as you like.
