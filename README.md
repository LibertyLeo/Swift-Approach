1. **`Function`** includes **`closures`** usage of swift.
2. **`Objects`** and **`classes's`** creation, also about its subclass and keywords such as `willSet`, `didSet`, `override`, `init`.

	1. Setting the value of properties that subclass declares.
	2. Calling the superclass's initializer.
	3. Changing the value of properties defined by the superclass. Any additional setup work that use methods, getters, or setters can also be done at this point.
3. **`Enumeration`** and **`struct`** creation.

1. **`Protocol`** and **`extension`** usage for expand original type such as classes, enumerations, strcture...

3. **`Generics`** is to defined the specified type of the function or type.
